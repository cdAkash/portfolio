        I'm <span className="font-extrabold text-3xl">Akash Yadav</span>, currently pursuing my MCA at Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology. 
              Yes, I'm also a Software Engineer. This portfolio might give you a glimpse of my front-end skills â€“ 
              I know, it's pretty basic. But hey, the back-end is where the magic happens. 
              Why don't you take a peek at my GitHub? You'll find a treasure trove of code, 
              sprinkled with some usual techy goodness like RESTful APIs, microservices, and maybe a dash of blockchain. 
              Dive in and enjoy the ride!
